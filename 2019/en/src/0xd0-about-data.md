Methodology and Data
====================

## Overview

Since the AppSec industry has not been specifically focused on most recent
applications architectures, in which APIs play an important role, compiling a
list of the ten most critical API security risks based on public data call would
have been a hard task. Despite no public data call was made, the resulting top
10 list is still based on publicly available data, security experts
contributions and open discussion with the security community.

## Methodology

In the first phase, publicly available data regarding APIs security incidents
were collected, reviewed, and categorized by a group of security experts. Such
data were collected from bug bounty platforms and vulnerability databases,
within a one-year-old time frame. It was used for statistical purposes.

In the next phase, security practitioners with penetration testing experience
were asked to compile their own top ten list.

The first draft of the OWASP API Security Top 10 2019 resulted from a consensus
between statistical results from phase one and the security practitioners lists.
This draft was then submitted to appreciation and review by another group of
security practitioners, with relevant experience in the API security fields.

The OWASP API Security Top 10 2019 was first presented in the OWASP Global
AppSec Tel Aviv event (May 2019). Since then it is available on GitHub for
public discussion and contributions.

The list of contributors is available in the [Acknowledgments][1] section.
