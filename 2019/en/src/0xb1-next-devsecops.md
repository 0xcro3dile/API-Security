What's Next For DevSecOps
=========================

Due to their importance in modern application architectures, building secure
APIs is crucial. Security can not be neglected and it should be part of the
whole development life-cycle. Scanning and penetration testing on a yearly basis
are not enough anymore.

DevSecOps should join the development effort, facilitating continuous security
testing across the entire software development life-cycle. Their goal is to
enhance the development pipeline with security automation and without impacting
development speed.

In case of doubt, better refreshing the [DevSecOps Manifesto][1].

| **Clearly Communicate Findings** | Contribute value with less or no friction. Deliver findings in a timely fashion, in the tools development teams are using (not PDF files). Join the development team to address the findings. Take the opportunity to educate them, clearly describing the weakness and how it can be abused, including an attack scenario to make it real. |
